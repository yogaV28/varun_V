Question: I take famotidine for acid indigestion and I'm taking drops for glaucoma. I have heard
that famotidine may contribute to glaucoma and want to know if this is true.?
Answer: While it is unlikely that famotidine is definitively related to glaucoma, it does fall in the
class of antihistamines (H2 Blocker) that may raise the risk of acute angle closure
glaucoma for some people with narrow angles.
With glaucoma, each person's risk profile is unique, so it's best to discuss your
medications with your ophthalmologist.. They can help determine which of your
medications you can safely take and the ones you should avoid.

Question: How does using antihistamines affect my glaucoma?
Answer: Antihistamines can cause an angle closure glaucoma attack (when fluid is completely
blocked from leaving the eye, causing a dangerous rise in pressure) in some patients
who have narrow angles. You should check with your ophthalmologist to learn what type
of glaucoma you have and whether antihistamine usage could cause this problem.

Question: What can I take for sea sickness if I have narrow angle glaucoma but have had an
iridotomy?
Answer: The type of medication taken for motion sickness can make your pupils dilate, which can
then raise the risk of a sudden increase in eye pressure (acute angle closure) and
possible vision loss. An iridotomy (a small opening in the iris usually made by a laser)
can be done to either bring the eye pressure back down, or to decrease the likelihood of
this happening in those who are felt to be at increased risk.
However, having an iridotomy does not completely eliminate the risk which varies from
person to person, so it is important to discuss this with your ophthalmologist who can
examine your eyes and advise you on whether taking motion sickness medications is
safe in your particular situation.
Unfortunately I'm not aware of any other types of medication for motion sickness, and
medication alternatives like acupressure wristbands have not been clearly shown to be
effective.

Question: I am using timolol eye drops and I might have myasthenia gravis—is it safe to use them?
Answer: Systemic beta blockers are generally not preferred in patients with myasthenia gravis (a
disorder that causes muscles to weaken and tire easily). They can cause fatigue but the
effect varies and is dependent on the type and dose. No information is available on
topical beta blockers (such as timolol eye drops) in myasthenia gravis.
If you take beta blockers to manage your glaucoma, it’s important to apply pressure on
the inner eyelids near the nose (called punctal occlusion) for 5 minutes after inserting the
drops to reduce absorption into the rest of the body.
If you notice that using the drops causes fatigue or worsens your symptoms, then
consult your ophthalmologist who may recommend stopping the drops to see if the
symptoms go away. You can then restart the beta blockers and see if symptoms worsen
again. If you determine that beta blocker drops do, in fact, worsens your myasthenia
gravis symptoms or cause fatigue you may then ask your ophthalmologist to choose
different options for your glaucoma treatment

Question: Can a corneal implant correct normal pressure glaucoma?
Answer: Corneal transplant surgery (which I assume you mean by "implant") is done for a variety
of reasons; unfortunately, glaucoma is not one of them. In fact, a possible complication
of corneal transplants is increased eye pressure. As a result, some people with
glaucoma may have more problems with their glaucoma or their transplants following
surgery. Cornea and glaucoma specialists know to monitor for these problems, and both
are typically involved in the management of such complicated cases.


Question: Can supplements help glaucoma?
Answer: There is no strong evidence at this time that either vitamin or non-vitamin supplements
can help glaucoma, however this is an area of ongoing research. A healthy, nutrient-rich
diet can lower your risk for certain eye diseases, however. It is important to talk to your
ophthalmologist and/or primary care provider about the possible risks before taking any
supplement.


Question: Can I have LASIK if I am a glaucoma suspect?
Answer: Given otherwise healthy eyes this should not be a problem. Modern-day LASIK does not
raise eye pressure much and it only does so for 15 to 20 seconds at most.


Question: My partner who has Alzheimer’s and does not want to take her glaucoma drops twice a
day. Can you combine two medications to lessen the aggravation of putting the drops in
morning and night?
Answer: Some glaucoma drops are available in a combined form, however most of these are not
available as generics. Some accredited compounding pharmacies offer combined forms
of two or even three different drops for easier dosing. There is also a newer drug that is
implanted in the eye, effectively taking the place of an eye drop for at least a few
months. Finally, there are a variety of procedures that can lower the eye pressure and
reduce, or sometimes even eliminate, the need for drops. All of these options have their
relative advantages and disadvantages. I would recommend discussing this issue further
with your partner's ophthalmologist.


Question: When I do visual field testing, it causes neck pain due to an old injury. Is there a shorter
version or a different test which would be less painful?
Answer: There are shorter test versions that can be performed on some visual field machines,
however in certain situations the longer test versions may be necessary. In either case,
good positioning is important: you should be seated comfortably with your back straight
and at the appropriate height for the test bowl, meaning you should not have to slump to
reach the chin rest or stretch to reach the forehead rest. You should discuss this problem
with your eye care provider.


Question: Is it safe to use a SAD light therapy lamp for insomnia with glaucoma, fibromyalgia and
chronic fatigue syndrome? It’s been suggested as part of "Sleep Restriction Therapy" for
insomnia where avoiding sleep is more likely to induce sleep.?
Answer: I cannot comment on the effectiveness of lights for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or
insomnia. But I do not think it is unsafe to use these treatments, and if you feel they are
helpful for your condition it is likely safe to use.
