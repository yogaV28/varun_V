Question: I take famotidine for acid indigestion and I'm taking drops for glaucoma. I have heard
that famotidine may contribute to glaucoma and want to know if this is true.
Answer: While it is unlikely that famotidine is definitively related to glaucoma, it does fall in the
class of antihistamines (H2 Blocker) that may raise the risk of acute angle closure
glaucoma for some people with narrow angles.
With glaucoma, each person's risk profile is unique, so it's best to discuss your
medications with your ophthalmologist.. They can help determine which of your
medications you can safely take and the ones you should avoid.

Question: How does using antihistamines affect my glaucoma?
Answer: Antihistamines can cause an angle closure glaucoma attack (when fluid is completely
blocked from leaving the eye, causing a dangerous rise in pressure) in some patients
who have narrow angles. You should check with your ophthalmologist to learn what type
of glaucoma you have and whether antihistamine usage could cause this problem.

Question: What can I take for sea sickness if I have narrow angle glaucoma but have had an
iridotomy?
Answer: The type of medication taken for motion sickness can make your pupils dilate, which can
then raise the risk of a sudden increase in eye pressure (acute angle closure) and
possible vision loss. An iridotomy (a small opening in the iris usually made by a laser)
can be done to either bring the eye pressure back down, or to decrease the likelihood of
this happening in those who are felt to be at increased risk.
However, having an iridotomy does not completely eliminate the risk which varies from
person to person, so it is important to discuss this with your ophthalmologist who can
examine your eyes and advise you on whether taking motion sickness medications is
safe in your particular situation.
Unfortunately I'm not aware of any other types of medication for motion sickness, and
medication alternatives like acupressure wristbands have not been clearly shown to be
effective.

Question: I am using timolol eye drops and I might have myasthenia gravis—is it safe to use them?
Answer: Systemic beta blockers are generally not preferred in patients with myasthenia gravis (a
disorder that causes muscles to weaken and tire easily). They can cause fatigue but the
effect varies and is dependent on the type and dose. No information is available on
topical beta blockers (such as timolol eye drops) in myasthenia gravis.
If you take beta blockers to manage your glaucoma, it’s important to apply pressure on
the inner eyelids near the nose (called punctal occlusion) for 5 minutes after inserting the
drops to reduce absorption into the rest of the body.
If you notice that using the drops causes fatigue or worsens your symptoms, then
consult your ophthalmologist who may recommend stopping the drops to see if the
symptoms go away. You can then restart the beta blockers and see if symptoms worsen
again. If you determine that beta blocker drops do, in fact, worsens your myasthenia
gravis symptoms or cause fatigue you may then ask your ophthalmologist to choose
different options for your glaucoma treatment

Question: Can a corneal implant correct normal pressure glaucoma?
Answer: Corneal transplant surgery (which I assume you mean by "implant") is done for a variety
of reasons; unfortunately, glaucoma is not one of them. In fact, a possible complication
of corneal transplants is increased eye pressure. As a result, some people with
glaucoma may have more problems with their glaucoma or their transplants following
surgery. Cornea and glaucoma specialists know to monitor for these problems, and both
are typically involved in the management of such complicated cases.


Question: Can supplements help glaucoma?
Answer: There is no strong evidence at this time that either vitamin or non-vitamin supplements
can help glaucoma, however this is an area of ongoing research. A healthy, nutrient-rich
diet can lower your risk for certain eye diseases, however. It is important to talk to your
ophthalmologist and/or primary care provider about the possible risks before taking any
supplement.


Question: Can I have LASIK if I am a glaucoma suspect?
Answer: Given otherwise healthy eyes this should not be a problem. Modern-day LASIK does not
raise eye pressure much and it only does so for 15 to 20 seconds at most.


Question: My partner who has Alzheimer’s and does not want to take her glaucoma drops twice a
day. Can you combine two medications to lessen the aggravation of putting the drops in
morning and night?
Answer: Some glaucoma drops are available in a combined form, however most of these are not
available as generics. Some accredited compounding pharmacies offer combined forms
of two or even three different drops for easier dosing. There is also a newer drug that is
implanted in the eye, effectively taking the place of an eye drop for at least a few
months. Finally, there are a variety of procedures that can lower the eye pressure and
reduce, or sometimes even eliminate, the need for drops. All of these options have their
relative advantages and disadvantages. I would recommend discussing this issue further
with your partner's ophthalmologist.


Question: When I do visual field testing, it causes neck pain due to an old injury. Is there a shorter
version or a different test which would be less painful?
Answer: There are shorter test versions that can be performed on some visual field machines,
however in certain situations the longer test versions may be necessary. In either case,
good positioning is important: you should be seated comfortably with your back straight
and at the appropriate height for the test bowl, meaning you should not have to slump to
reach the chin rest or stretch to reach the forehead rest. You should discuss this problem
with your eye care provider.


Question: Is it safe to use a SAD light therapy lamp for insomnia with glaucoma, fibromyalgia and
chronic fatigue syndrome? It’s been suggested as part of "Sleep Restriction Therapy" for
insomnia where avoiding sleep is more likely to induce sleep.
Answer: I cannot comment on the effectiveness of lights for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or
insomnia. But I do not think it is unsafe to use these treatments, and if you feel they are
helpful for your condition it is likely safe to use.


Question: What is eye pressure?
Answer: The eye is a closed ball filled with clear jelly (vitreous humor) in the back behind the lens
and clear fluid (aqueous humor) in the front, between the iris and the cornea. Aqueous
humor is created just behind the iris and is in continuous circulation throughout the front
part of the eye before it drains out just in front of the iris where it meets the cornea. This
fluid helps keep the eye "inflated" just like air inside a balloon.
We can measure pressure of the eye just like you can gauge how full a balloon is by
poking the balloon with your finger. The less air or pressure in the balloon, the easier it
will be to poke and conversely, the more air or pressure in the balloon, the stiffer the
balloon will be and the harder it will be to poke it. We measure pressure in the eye the
same way; by gently touching the cornea with special instruments to see how hard it is
to "poke." The unit of measurement is millimeters of mercury, or mmHg.
Pressure in the human eye, known as intraocular pressure, varies throughout the day
with "normal" pressure being anywhere between 10 and 21 mmHg. Glaucoma is an eye
disease in which the optic nerve is damaged by the pressure inside the eye. In most
cases, the damaging pressure is greater than 21 mmHg, but there are some patients
who can have damage at lower pressures (known as normotensive glaucoma).
Conversely, there are some people who can tolerate higher-than-normal pressures
without having optic nerve damage. These people are said to have "ocular
hypertension". Eye pressure can vary with the thickness of the cornea—this is also
measured when trying to interpret the significance of an eye pressure—reading in any
one patient.
In addition to high pressure, risk factors for glaucoma include African or Hispanic
ancestry, having diabetes and having a family member with glaucoma. Glaucoma does
not typically cause pain and many cases of glaucoma go undiagnosed. Checking eye
pressure is an important part of a comprehensive eye exam and one good reason to get
regular check-ups by your ophthalmologist or eye care provider.


Question: I've recently been diagnosed with pigment dispersion syndrome and ocular
hypertension. Is it still safe for me to get LASIK?
Answer: Neither pigment dispersion syndrome or ocular hypertension should have any effect on
having successful LASIK surgery. But both should be evaluated by your eye surgeon
before you have LASIK.


Question: What drops do you recommend to relieve the sting of glaucoma eye drops?
Answer: We usually recommend using a lubricant eye drop (standard, not gel which would be too
thick) 10 to 15 minutes before using your glaucoma drops. This may relieve the stinging
sensation, which is often due to dry eye. Cold is also an effective anesthetic (pain killer).
So consider keeping the lubricant eye drops in the refrigerator for additional relief from
the temporary stinging, burning and itching.


Question: I'm at risk for glaucoma and my doctor considers me a "glaucoma suspect." Can I still get my
yearly exam during this COVID pandemic?
Answer: A person is a glaucoma suspect when they have risk factors for glaucoma, like high
intraocular pressure (IOP).
At this point in the pandemic, our office asks that patients postpone routine in-office visits for
this type of annual monitoring/maintenance. In this time of social distancing, for your
protection and the protection of our more vulnerable patients who must come in for urgent
visits, we are aggressively trying to limit patient flow through our offices. The best thing to do
is call your ophthalmologist who can provide guidance for you.


Question: My wife has chronic cough caused by her glaucoma eye drops. She stopped taking the
drops for a couple weeks, and also switched drops three times, but each time the
coughing returns. She had one laser surgery that didn't work. What else can she do?
Answer: At this point, it sounds like conservative measures have been exhausted. Ask your
ophthalmologist about the different surgical alternatives that may help manage your
wife’s glaucoma.


Question: Does increased IOP cause the eyeball to feel hardened? If so, is a person able to tell if
their IOP is high by how firm or soft their eyeball feels?
Answer: The eye pressure typically must be very high for the eye to feel “hard.” Touching
(palpating) the eyeball through the eyelid is called a “tactile” pressure and is not a very
accurate way of determining eye pressure. You should never directly touch the surface
of your eyeball because this can cause injury and infection. Most patients and physicians
are not able to accurately determine the eye pressure by touching (palpating) the eye, so
it always is best to see your ophthalmologist regularly to have your eye pressure
accurately measured.


Question: Should patients with severe glaucoma allow their eyes to be dilated during exam? Are
there risks?
Answer: For patients with severe peripheral vision loss due to open angle glaucoma, there is
usually little risk from being dilated for an exam. Some patients with open angle
glaucoma will have a pressure spike (high intraocular pressure) after dilation, so your
ophthalmologist should occasionally check your eye pressure after you have been
dilated to see if your eye pressure rises. Patients who are found to “spike” with dilation
can be given pressure lowering drops before dilation to prevent the spike. This is
particularly important for patients who require frequent dilation, such as those seeing a
retina specialist for macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy.
Dilation is more risky in patients who have a narrow angle, where the iris (colored part of
the eye) is very close to the cornea (clear window at the front of the eye). Dilating drops
can raise pressure in these patients by closing off the drainage angle of the eye. If your
narrow angle poses such a risk, your ophthalmologist will usually perform a laser
peripheral iridotomy, which makes a microscopic hole in the iris so the pressure will not
go up when the eye is dilated. Cataract surgery also “cures” this condition. In summary,
your ophthalmologist will know whether your eye is safe to be dilated after the initial
exam.


Question: Does an ophthalmologist perform the same tests for glaucoma and myasthenia gravis?
Answer: There is no overlap in testing for glaucoma and myasthenia gravis. Glaucoma is a
disease related to intraocular pressure and the ensuing damage to the optic nerve in the
back of the eye. Myasthenia gravis is a disease that can affect the muscles controlling
the eyes and eyelid movement. These are different diseases that require different
testing.


Question: Can you tell me what treatment is recommended for pseudoexfoliation glaucoma? Is
there anything a patient can do to help the situation?
Answer: Similar to other types of glaucoma, the goal with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (when
flaky dandruff-like deposits inside the eye block fluid from leaving the eye, causing
pressure to rise) is to reduce eye pressure to prevent additional damage to the optic
nerve.
Typically, we first try topical eye drops to reduce eye pressure. Patients with
pseudoexfoliation glaucoma that is mild to moderate also tend to respond particularly
well to selective laser trabeculoplasty, which is a low-risk, in-office procedure.
There are also some minimally invasive glaucoma surgery options for mild to moderate
pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, such as iStent, trabectome, or endoscopic
cyclophotocoagulation. If the glaucoma is more advanced or the patient needs
significant eye pressure lowering, more traditional glaucoma surgery such as
trabeculectomy or aqueous shunt implant is recommended.
The best thing a patient with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma can do is to live a generally
healthy lifestyle with good diet and exercise, be diligent about following their
ophthalmologist's instructions for using medications, and returning for regular follow-up
with their ophthalmologist so any changes in the glaucoma or eye pressure can be noted
right away.
Finally, it is important to note that some patients with pseudoexfoliation also have narrow
angles (when the colored part of your eye is pushed too far forward), which can put you
at risk for angle closure attacks of elevated eye pressure. Everyone with
pseudoexfoliation should be evaluated by their ophthalmologist for narrow angle.


Question: Is it safe for a person who takes eye drops for glaucoma to use nasal sprays such as
Nasacort?
Answer: Nasacort is a steroid and it is certainly possible to have steroid-associated intraocular
pressure elevations from nasal steroids. Fortunately, most patients will not have an
associated pressure rise. However, whenever a nasal steroid is introduced in a patient
with glaucoma, or at higher risk for developing glaucoma, monitoring by an
ophthalmologist is warranted.
