While her HVF OD in 2019 appears stable, her HVF OS in 2019 appears progressed. She had some episodes of systemic hypotension during her chemotherapy in 2017, which may have contributed to her glaucoma progression. Her systemic blood pressure is now relatively stable. Given her level of optic neuropathy, I think she needs a target IOP of <18 OD and <12 OS. She is nearly at target OD and needs lower pressure OS. She is on near ***, and is s/p SLT OS. Options include maximizing topical therapy, and potentially surgical intervention, including trabeculectomy. Would prefer to maximize topical therapy prior to recommending surgery. Discussed that if surgical intervention is necessary, given her drive distance to ******** (she lives south of *****), I would highly surgery and post op care closer to home, including with Dr. ****** ******* in ***** (who ******** trabeculectomy surgeries).

Fortunately, I don't see any evidence of VF progression on the studies provided by referring physician (2016-2018). Thus, I don't see an immediate reason for recommending surgery to lower the IOP (including trabeculectomy). Given this thicker CCT, his target IOP is probably about 15 or lower, which is essentially at today OU. If IOP becomes higher consistently, or if there is evidence of VF progression, then would recommend surgical intervention.  2.

Has a history of floaters in both eyes for ~ 50 years. Patient feels SLT may have made things worse.  Has been back on Latanoprost for about 2 months - had used it a few years ago but says that was taken off for reason unknown.  Patient would like any surgery/care be done here rather than with Dr. ******'s office.  Is able to get referrals here from the VA due to where he lives. Says diagnosed with glaucoma about 2 years ago at a Costco - had gone in to get new contacts, says IOP was 28 and 29 at that point.  Took pictures and left nerve was much bigger than right.  Has been on drops since.  Is now developing cataract in the left eye and feels vision is significantly worse - feels drops are not working.  Has never been put on a drop that he was not able to tolerate. Reports very good compliance with drops.  No eye pain to report. ***** soft contacts - but not for about a year.
